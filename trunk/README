==Introduction==

The Selector Shell is a javascript tool for testing what CSS turns into
in different browsers.
It works by taking some raw text, inserting a dynamic STYLE element
into the HEAD with that raw text as its content, and then reading the
CSSOM to see what the browser has parsed it into.
